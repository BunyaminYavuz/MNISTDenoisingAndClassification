# MNIST Noise Reduction Project

This project demonstrates the effects of noise on MNIST digit classification and the improvements achieved using denoising techniques.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains scripts for downloading and preprocessing data.
- **src/**: Includes modules for data preprocessing, visualization, and model training.
- **results/**: Stores output plots and results.
- **notebooks/**: Interactive Jupyter notebooks.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Download data: `python data/download_mnist.py`
3. Train and evaluate models: See `python models/train_model.py`
4. Run the project : `python main.py`

## Results
Comparison of model performance on noisy and cleaned data.
